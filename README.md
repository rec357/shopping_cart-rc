# shopping_cart-rc

Run the script by typing "python" and the name of the file, so it should be python shopping_cart.py

Then, you'll see the prompt to enter a product identifier.

The values for product identifiers are found in the data set and they're numbered from 1 to 20.

When you're done, type DONE to see the pricing of your total number of products you selected plus tax.

If you do not enter a valid product identifier, you will receive a prompt saying "Invalid input. Please enter valid id :)".

Once you see the subtotal, tax, and total at the bottom, you will also see a closing statement.
